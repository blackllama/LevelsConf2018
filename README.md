# LevelsConf2018
This contains the slidedeck and code from my talk at Levels Conf. 

This project is a super basic serverless implementation that uses AWS S3, Lambda and API Gateway to convert big images into slack emoji sized images

Read through the slides for a run down on steps. 

Remember to delete all resources once you've got it working - the policies on this project make everything publically accessible and is not productionisable! 
If you do want to use it for realsies, put it behind some more stringent access management. Docs for that are at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html
